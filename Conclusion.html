  <h1><center>Conclusion</center></h1>
  <p style="font-size:40px">The Black Power Salute had the responsibility to advocate for the liberation of the African-American community and fight for the right to live free from racial oppression because the Black Power Salute was about getting equality and empowering the black community and getting justice because they were faced with poverty, police violence, and lack of civil rights  and they did  it  because it had to be done they had  used their talent to help those who didn't have a platform to voice their not because they wanted too but just because it had to be done.</p>
