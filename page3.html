    During their medal ceremony in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City on October 16, 1968, two African-American
    athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, each raised a black-gloved fist during the playing of the US national
    anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner".

    IOC president Avery Brundage ordered Tommie Smith and John Carlos to both be suspended from the U.S. Olympic team
    and forced out of the Olympic Village because of their protest.
    the US Olympic Committee refused, Brundage threatened to ban the entire US track team so they were were forced to
    kick them off the team.
    A spokesman for the IOC said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental
    principles of the Olympic spirit
    Peter George Norman was an Australian track athlete.He knew the salute was going to occur and he wore a badge of the
    Olympic Project for Human Rights in support of fellow athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith.
    Peter Norman had said, 'I'll stand with you'. Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman's eyes. He didn't; 'I
    saw love'."

    After the olypimcs Norman returned home to Australia as a pariah, suffering unofficial sanction, and was ridiculed
    as the forgotten man of the Black Power salute. He was not selected for the 1972 Olympics and never ran in an
    Olympics again.
