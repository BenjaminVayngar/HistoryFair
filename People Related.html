    The International Olympic Committee (also known as the I.O.C.) President Avery Brundage ordered Tommie Smith and John Carlos to both be suspended from the U.S. Olympic team and forced out of the Olympic Village because of their protest. The U.S. Olympic Committee refused, however Brundage threatened to ban the entire U.S. track team, so they were forced to leave the team. A spokesman for the I.O.C. said Smith and Carlos's actions were "a deliberate and violent breach of the fundamental principles of the Olympic spirit" (“1968 Olympics Black Power salute”). Peter George Norman was an Australian track athlete, and he knew the salute was going to occur. In preparation, he wore a badge of the Olympic Project for Human Rights in support of fellow athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith. Peter Norman said, "I'll stand with you" (“Peter Norman”) when talking with the other athletes. Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman's eyes, but he didn't- "I saw love" (“1968 Olympics Black Power salute”).

    Smith and Carlos returned home with their heads high, but it didn't last long. Pressure built up from anonymous death threats led to being a factor in the suicide of John Carlos's wife. Carlos worked at a series of dead-end jobs before becoming a counselor at Palm Springs High School, where he has been for the past 20 years. He retired when he was 64 and now lives with his third wife, Delois, outside Atlanta. He had nine children and stepchildren. The two athletes share what Smith calls a "strained and strange" relationship. Carlos says he let Smith pass him in 1968 because he believed that Tommie Smith would have never put his fist in the sky had I won that race.

    "But both men insist they have no regrets about 1968. 'I went up there as a dignified black man and said: ‘What's going on is wrong,‘' Carlos says. Their protest, Smith says, 'was a cry for freedom and for human rights. We had to be seen because we couldn't be heard.'" (Davis)

    After the Olympics, Norman returned home to Australia as a pariah, suffering an unofficial sanction, and was ridiculed as the forgotten man of the Black Power Salute. He was not selected for the 1972 Olympics and never ran in an Olympics again.
