  <p style="font-size:30px">On October 16, 1968, during the medal presentations at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, protesting against discrimination, raised a black-gloved fist during the playing of the U.S. national anthem. This would later be called The Black Power Salute, an act that scandalized the Olympics. Smith later said, "If I win I am an American, not a black American. But if I did something bad then they would say 'a Negro'. We are black and we are proud of being black ... Black America will understand what we did tonight" (“1968 Olympics Black Power salute”). This shows how they were bringing awareness to the Olympics and America through protesting against racial discrimination.</p>
