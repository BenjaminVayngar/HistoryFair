    On Oct. 16, 1968, during medal presentations at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, two African-American athletes, raised a black-gloved fist during the playing of the US national anthem. This would later be called The Black Power salute which was an act that scandalized the Olympics. Tommie Smith and John Carlos were protesting aganist against discrimination Smith later saying, "If I win I am an American, not a black American. But if I did something bad then they would say 'a Negro'. We are black and we are proud of being black ... Black America will understand what we did tonight" (“1968 Olympics Black Power salute”). This shows how they were bringing awarness to the olympics and America through protesting aginst racial discrimination.
